/**
 * Interface for combined interface hosts (both tile and part).
 * <p>
 * A combined interface wraps multiple resource-specific logics (item, fluid, gas, essentia)
 * behind a single block/part. It shares one upgrade inventory across all logics and
 * provides tab-based GUI access to each resource type.
 * <p>
 * Due to Java's type erasure, the combined host CANNOT implement both IItemInterfaceHost
 * and IFluidInterfaceHost (both extend IFilterableInterfaceHost with different type parameters).
 * Instead, typed access is provided through dedicated logic accessors.
